# Auckland Parking
A web app that shows parking spots in Auckland. Parking locations with mobility spots are indicated by blue markers with the respective amount of spots on them.

This was created as a small test usage of the Google Maps API and makes small use of external libraries. Currently, the Auckland Transport v2 API does not support cross browser requests so Auckland Parking makes use of the v1 API, which is limited to 100 requests per day.
